# fouriertheartist

Our senior project implementation of manim and other python libraries to create a digital art experience that builds intuitive understanding of higher math concepts. Centered around the pivotal work of Joseph Fourier, we hope to expand on the great library built by 3B1B on his YouTube channel by adding additional electrical engineering centric content.
